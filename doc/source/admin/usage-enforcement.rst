Usage Enforcement
=================

Synopsis
========

Usage enforcement and lease constraints can be implemented by operators via
custom usage enforcement filters or an external service.

Description
===========

Usage enforcement filters are called on ``lease_create``, ``lease_update`` and
``on_end`` operations. The filters check whether or not lease values or
allocation criteria pass admin defined thresholds. There are currently two
filters provided out-of-the-box. ``MaxLeaseDurationFilter`` restricts the
duration of leases. ``ExternalServiceFilter`` calls a third-party service for
implementing policies using a URL configured in ``blazar.conf``.

Options
=======

All filters are a subclass of the BaseFilter class located in
``blazar/enforcement/filter/base_filter.py``. Custom filters must implement
methods for ``check_create``, ``check_update``, and ``on_end``. The
``MaxLeaseDurationFilter`` is a good example to follow. Filters are enabled in
``blazar.conf`` under the ``[enforcement]`` group. For example, enabling the
``MaxLeaseDurationFilter`` to limit lease durations to only one day would work
as follows:

.. sourcecode:: console

   [enforcement]
   enabled_filters = MaxLeaseDurationFilter
   max_lease_duration = 86400

..

MaxLeaseDurationFilter
----------------------

This filter simply examines the lease ``start_date`` and ``end_date``
attributes and rejects the lease if its duration exceeds a threshold. It
supports two configuration options:

* ``max_lease_duration``
* ``max_lease_duration_exempt_project_ids``

See the :doc:`../configuration/blazar-conf` page for a description of these
options.

ExternalServiceFilter
---------------------

This filter delegates the decision for each API to an external HTTP service.
The service must use token-based authentication and implement the following
endpoints for POST method:

* ``POST /v1/check-create``
* ``POST /v1/check-update``
* ``POST /v1/on-end``

The external service should return ``204 No Content`` if the parameters meet
defined criteria and ``403 Forbidden`` if not.

Example format of data the external service will receive in a request body:

* Request example:

.. sourcecode:: json
