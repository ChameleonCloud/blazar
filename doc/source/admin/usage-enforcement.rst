=================
Usage Enforcement
=================

Synopsis
========

Usage enforcement and lease constraints can be implemented by operators via
custom usage enforcement filters or an external service.

Description
===========

Usage enforcement filters are called on lease_create, lease_update and on_end
operations. The filters check for whether or not lease values or allocation
criteria passes admin defined thresholds. There are currently two filters
provided out-of-the-box. The MaxReservationLengthFilter restricts the length
of a user leases. The ExternalServiceFilter calls a third-party service
for implementing policies using token-based authentication and url provided
in blazar.conf.

Options
=======

All filters are a subclass of BaseFilter class located in
blazar/enforcement/filter/base_filter.py. Custom filters must implement methods
for check_create, check_update, and on_end. The MaxReservationLengthFilter is
a good example to follow.

Filters are enabled via in blazar.conf under the enforcement group. For
example, enabling the MaxReservationLengthFilter to limit lease lengths to only
one day would work as follows:

.. sourcecode:: console

  [enforcement]
  enabled_filters = MaxReservationLengthFilter
  max_reservation_length = 86400

..

MaximumReservationLengthFilter
------------------------------

This filter simply examines the lease's ``end_time`` and ``start_time`` and
rejects the lease if its length exceeds a threshold.

ExternalServiceFilter
---------------------

This filter delegates the decision for each API to an external HTTP service.
The service must use token-based authentication and implement the following
endpoints for POST method:

* ``POST /v1/check-create``
* ``POST /v1/check-update``
* ``POST /v1/on-end``

The external service should return ``204 No Content`` if the parameters meet
defined criteria and ``403 Forbidden`` if not.

Example format of data the external service will receive in a request body:

* Request example:
