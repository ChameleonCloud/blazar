    Blazar now supports being deployed in a multi-region setup. Operators of
    OpenStack deployments with multiple regions must set the new configuration
    option ``[DEFAULT]/os_region_name``. See `the configuration reference
    <https://docs.openstack.org/blazar/queens/configuration/blazar-conf.html#DEFAULT.os_region_name>`_
    for more details.
