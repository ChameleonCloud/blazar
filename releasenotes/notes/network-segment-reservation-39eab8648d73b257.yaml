  Adds support for reserving VLAN or VXLAN network segments.
features:
  - |
    Site operators can now add network segments to Blazar's reservable
    inventory. Users can create a lease that includes one or more reservations
    for a network segment. While the user's lease is active, Neutron networks
    for any reserved segments will be associated with the user's project.
other:
  - |
    When tearing down a network reservation, the Neutron network is deleted.
    As part of this, any instances connected to the network will have their ports
    deleted, and will lose connectivity if not attached to any other networks.
